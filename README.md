## Iris Recognition
- In this project, we use the methods of PCA(principal component analysis) and fisher LDA to make an iris recognition system. We use PCA on an image after pre processing to reduce the dimensionality of the image, followed by a LDA based classifier.
- Its advantages over the traditional approaches which use Wavelet and Hough transforms on iris images, followed by various matching algorithms
is that it allows for a much faster recognition combined with a high accuracy.
- For more details about our method and its accuracy, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/shubhangb97/IrisRecognition/blob/master/VineetShubhangAniketCS663%20(2).pptx">presentation</a>.
